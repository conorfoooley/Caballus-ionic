<p>Dear -recipientFirst- -recipientLast-,</p>
<p>
    The 3rd party payment arrangement is no longer active. As such your subscription that allows you
    to have multiple horses enabled on your account has been cancelled. You can log into your
    account to select which horse you would like to have enabled (the first one in the list is
    currently selected), or you can setup direct payment from your account, or re-establish a
    payment arrangement to enable multiple horses again.This could payment termination can happen
    for a number of reasons, intentional or unintentional.You might reach out to the original payer
    if this was unexpected in the event that they are unaware of this change.
